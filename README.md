## Prerequisites

**Installing NodeJS**

Make sure that you have a recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/download/) on your machine.
You might want to use an IDE of your choice, we recommand [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) if you don't have one yet.   

Depending on your installation you might have access to both [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/download/) and [npm](https://nodejs.dev/download/), you can check if either are on your machine by running the command below. 

**You may check your node & npm version by running**:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
./vendor/bin/sail composer require laravel/breeze --dev
./vendor/bin/sail artisan breeze:install

./vendor/bin/sail npm install
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev

./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate 

```

Note that in this repository whenever you see `npm` it will be assumed that it is the **latest version** of the package.
